It is a fully automatic traffic prediction system. First of all the we will name the Road by Road 1, Road 2, Road 3 & Road 4. If the Road 1 is on then at that time the other 3 Roads (Road 2, Road 3 & Road 4) will be barricaded. Now the Ultrasonic sensor will calculate the traffic of Road 2 and according to the traffic it will allot the time to Road 2 and when Road 1 time is done then automatically it will barricade the Road 1 and Road 2 barricade will be on and then it will calculate the traffic of Road 3 and accordingly the process will go on. According to this process we can save time.
